Hello Pierre and Sibylle,

The translation of the observed data work as follow:

* All the sheets having the pattern (begins with) Obs, they will be translated to the observed/timeseries path, if you don't want to translate yet just rename the sheet like "notObs" 
* All the sheets having the pattern (begins with) Summary will be located in the path observed/ not in the timeseries one.

To consider: IDs works like in the events (eid or treat_id).

I will share with you the file compiled to windows:
